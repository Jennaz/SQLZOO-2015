#Answer:
SELECT continent, name, area FROM world x
  WHERE area >= ALL
    (SELECT area FROM world y

          AND area>0)
          
7.Find the continents where all countries have a population <= 25000000. 
Then find the names of the countries associated with these continents. 
Show name, continent and population.

#Answer1:
SELECT name, continent, population 
FROM world x  
WHERE continent NOT IN(SELECT DISTINCT continent FROM world
WHERE population >= 25000000)

#Answer2: (if we do not want to use double negative to solve this question, this is another solution)#
SELECT distinct name, continent,population
FROM world
WHERE continent in (
	SELECT continent
	FROM(
		SELECT  continent, population
 		FROM world x
 		WHERE population  >= ALL
    		(
    		SELECT population 
    		FROM world y
        	WHERE y.continent=x.continent
         	 AND population>0) ) AS new_table
	where new_table.population<=25000000)
